# Search Tree

Please refer to the MIT03 video and the class design in the attachment to realize the template implementation of the binary search tree. Require:

1. Template must be used to realize the abstraction of node data types;

2. Please implement at least the following functions: constructor and destructor, min, max, successor, predecessor, tree_search, insert functions;

3. Optional: complete the delete function;

4. A sorting algorithm based on BST is to insert BST one by one, and then use inorder_treewalk to output; since we have not considered how to balance a BST for the time being, a lazy solution is to shuffle the input array, and then insert BST one by one, Then traverse the output in order. Please implement this function and discuss its stability and efficiency (compared to random quicksort);

5. Please submit your code, where BinarySearchTree.h is the design and implementation of all template classes, and then submit a main.cpp, which is the test of all your functions. Allows appropriate construction of member functions specifically for testing. At the same time, submit an explanatory document of no more than 5 pages in A4. In addition to the above-mentioned explanations for sorting, you also need to explain your test plan and results.
