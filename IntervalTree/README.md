# Interval Tree

1. Based on the red-black tree structure, expand it into an interval tree. Implement the Interval-Search(i) function. The endpoints of the range are floating point numbers (double).

2. Build reasonable test data yourself and test your data.

3. The test results are written into a text or latex file named report, and all relevant content is stored in the IntervalTree/doc directory, and the length should not exceed one A4 page.
