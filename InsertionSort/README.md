# Insertion Sort

Through numerical experiment, verify that the worst relative time complexity of insertion sort is
$$t_n = \theta(n^2)$$
where $n$ represents the input size of the problem, in this example, refers to the array length of the input group to be sorted; $t_n$ represents the actual time spent on an insertion sort process with an input size of n.
